## Template Literals

String concatenation is hard. Take this code for example.

```js
function makeGreeting (name, email, id) {
  return 'Hello, ' + name + 
    '. We\'ve emailed you at ' + email +
    '. Your user id is "' + id + '".'
}
```

All weâ€™re trying to do is take three variables (`name`, `email`, and `id`) and create a sentence using them. Sadly, in order to do that, itâ€™s a balancing act between using the right quotations, `+` signs, and escaping (`\`) the right characters. This is the exact problem that Template Literals (also called Template Strings) was created to solve.

With Template Literals, instead of using single (`''`) or double quotes (`""`), you use backticks (````) (located to the left of the `1` key if youâ€™re using a QWERTY keyboard ðŸ™‚). Anywhere inside of your backticks where you have an expression (a piece of code that results in a single value like a variable or function invocation), you can wrap that expression in `${expression goes here}`.

So using Template Literals, we can take the confusing `makeGreeting` function above and simplify it to look like this.

```js
function makeGreeting (name, email, id) {
  return `Hello, ${name}. We've emailed you at ${email}. Your user id is "${id}".`
}
```

Much better. No more worrying about using the right quotations, `+` signs, and escaping the right characters. Not only is it easier to write, but itâ€™s also much easier to read.

Now instead of having a `makeGreeting` function, say we wanted a `makeGreetingTemplate` function that returned us an HTML string that we could throw into the DOM. Without template strings, weâ€™d have something like this.

```js
function makeGreetingTemplate (name, email, id) {
  return '<div>' +
    '<h1>Hello, ' + name + '.</h1>' +
    '<p>We\'ve emailed you at ' + email + '. ' +
    'Your user id is "' + id + '".</p>' +
  '</div>'
}
```

Perfect, except for the fact that not only is it terribly hard to write, itâ€™s even harder to read. Whatâ€™s nice about ES6â€™s Template Strings is they also support multi-line strings. That means, using Template Strings, we can rewrite `makeGreetingTemplate` to look like this.

```js
function makeGreetingTemplate (name, email, id) {
  return `
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, ${name}</h1>
      <p>
        We've email you at ${email}.
        Your user id is "${id}".
      </p>
    </div>
  `
}
```

I consider that an absolute win.
