Historically (with Class components), the way weâ€™ve accomplished the state management is by adding a `state` property on the componentâ€™s instance (`this`) and updating that state with the `setState` method.

```jsx
class Theme extends React.Component {
  state = {
    theme: "light"
  }
  toDark = () => this.setState({ theme: "dark" })
  toLight = () => this.setState({ theme: "light" })
  render() {
    const { theme } = this.state

    return (
      <div className={theme}>
        {theme === "light" 
          ? <button onClick={this.toDark}>ðŸ”¦</button>
          : <button onClick={this.toLight}>ðŸ’¡</button>}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

But with React Hooks, we use function components and make them stateful with the `useState` Hook.

#### useState

> 1. Add state to functional components
> 2. Preserve values between renders and trigger a re-render of the component 

`useState` comes built-in with React and can be accessed via `React.useState`.

It takes in a single argument, the initial value for that piece of state, and returns an array with the first item being the state value and the second item being a way to update that state.

```jsx
const themeArray = React.useState('light')
const theme = themeArray[0]
const setTheme = themeArray[1] 

...

theme // 'light'
setTheme('dark')
theme // 'dark'
```

The canonical and more precise way to write the code above is to use Array destructuring and put it all on one line.

```jsx
function Theme () {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light')

  const toDark = () => setTheme('dark')
  const toLight = () => setTheme('light')

  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {theme === "light"
        ? <button onClick={toDark}>ðŸ”¦</button>
        : <button onClick={toLight}>ðŸ’¡</button>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

##### The Mental Model

`useState`allows you to trigger a component re-render, and it can preserve values between renders.

###### Trigger Re-renders

Similiar to `setState`. When updating the current state value with the updater function that `useState` provides, React will cause a re-render to the component, updating the UI.

###### Preserve Values

`useState` is the tool to preserve values between function calls/renders and to trigger a re-render of the component.

##### setState vs useState

First, thereâ€™s no more instance wide API for updating all of the state of the component as there was with `setState`. Instead, each piece of state comes with its own updater function. 

Second, and this is related to the first point, thereâ€™s no instance wide API for setting the initial values of all of the state properties on the component as there was with `state = {}`. Instead, each unique piece of state should have its own `useState`invocation (and therefore its own value and updater function).

- Class

```js
state = {
  loading: true,
  authed: false,
  repos: []
}
```

- useState

```js
const [ loading, setLoading ] = React.useState(true)
const [ authed, setAuthed ] = React.useState(false)
const [ repos, setRepos ] = React.useState([])
```

- State Object

Most important distinction between `setState` and `useState` is how they handle objects.

**setState**

`setState` would **merge** the two objects to form the new state.

```jsx
state = {
  loading: true,
  authed: false,
  repos: []
}
setLoading = (loading) => {
  this.setState({ 
    loading 
  }) // wouldn't modify "authed" or "repos".
}
```

**useState**

`useState` wonâ€™t merge the new object with the previous state. Instead, itâ€™ll **replace** it completely.

```jsx
const [ state, setState ] = React.useState({
  loading: true,
  authed: false,
  repos: []
})

const setLoading = (loading) => {
  setState({
    loading
  }) // state.authed and state.repos are now gone.
}
```

Of course, you can get around this by manually merging the previous state with the new state if you want, but thatâ€™ll come with a performance hit.

```js
const setLoading = (loading) => {
  setState({
    ...state,
    loading
  })
}
```

If the most logical data type for your piece of state is an object, itâ€™s best to use the `useReducer` Hook which weâ€™ll see in an upcoming lesson.

##### Functional Updates

With `setState` or `useState`, whenever you set the current state based on the previous state, itâ€™s recommended to pass a function as an argument to `setState` or `useState` instead of an object.

The reason for this is state updates may be asynchronous.

Passing them a function that receives `state` rather than relying on referencing state from the component instance.

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 }
  increment = () => this.setState(({ count }) => ({ count: count + 1}))
  decrement = () => this.setState(({ count }) => ({ count: count - 1}))
  render () {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>
        <h1>{this.state.count}</h1>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
      </React.Fragment>
    )
  }
}
```

```jsx
function Counter () {
  const [ count, setCount ] = React.useState(0)

  const increment = () => setCount((count) => count + 1)
  const decrement = () => setCount((count) => count - 1)

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

##### Lazy State Initializations

Hereâ€™s a scenario. What if the initial value for a piece of state was the result of an expensive calculation? Something like this.

```jsx
function getExpensiveCount () {
  console.log('Calculating initial count')
  return 999
}

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(getExpensiveCount())

  const increment = () => setCount((count) => count + 1)
  const decrement = () => setCount((count) => count - 1)

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

Even though React only uses the value calculated from `getExpensiveCount` on the initial render, anytime the component re-renders, the  `getExpensiveCount` is being invoked.

If the initial value for a piece of state is the result of an expensive calculation, you can pass `useState` a function that when invoked, will resolve to the initial state. When `useState` sees that it received a function as its initial state argument, itâ€™ll only invoke it once on the initial render.

```jsx
function getExpensiveCount () {
  console.log('Calculating initial count')
  return 999
}

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(() => getExpensiveCount())

  const increment = () => setCount((count) => count + 1)
  const decrement = () => setCount((count) => count - 1)

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

If youâ€™re confused by the difference between the last two examples, note that the key lies in what we pass to `useState`. In the first example, we pass `useState` a function **invocation**. In the second, we pass it a function **definition**. What that means is that, from `useState`'s perspective, in the first example, it receives 999 since thatâ€™s what `getExpensiveCount` returns. In the second, it receives a function that it needs to invoke to get the initial value.
