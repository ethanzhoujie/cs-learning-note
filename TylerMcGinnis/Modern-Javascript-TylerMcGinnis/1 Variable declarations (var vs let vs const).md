## Variable declarations (var vs let vs const)

ES2015 (or ES6) introduced two new ways to create variables, `let` and `const`. But before we actually dive into the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`, there are some prerequisites you need to know first. They are variable declarations vs initialization, scope (specifically function scope), and hoisting.

#### Variable Declaration vs Initialization

A variable declaration introduces a new identifier.

```js
var declaration
```

Above we create a new identifier called declaration. In JavaScript, variables are initialized with the value of `undefined` when they are created. What that means is if we try to log the `declaration` variable, we‚Äôll get `undefined`.

```js
var declaration

console.log(declaration) // undefined
```

So if we log the declaration variable, we get undefined.

In contract to variable declaration, variable initialization is when you first assign a value to a variable.

```js
var declaration

console.log(declaration) // undefined

declaration = 'This is an initialization'
```

So here we‚Äôre initializing the `declaration` variable by assigning it to a string.

This leads us to our second concept, Scope.

#### Scope

Scope defines where variables and functions are accessible inside of your program. In JavaScript, there are two kinds of scope - **global scope**, and **function scope**. According to the official spec,

> ‚ÄúIf the variable statement occurs inside a FunctionDeclaration, the variables are defined with function-local scope in that function.‚Äù.

What that means is if you create a variable with `var`, that variable is ‚Äúscoped‚Äù to the function it was created in and is only accessible inside of that function or, any nested functions.

```js
function getDate () {
  var date = new Date()

  return date
}

getDate()
console.log(date) // ‚ùå Reference Error
```

Above we try to access a variable outside of the function it was declared. Because `date` is ‚Äúscoped‚Äù to the `getData` function, it‚Äôs only accessible inside of `getDate` itself or any nested functions inside of `getDate` (as seen below).

```js
function getDate () {
  var date = new Date()

  function formatDate () {
    return date.toDateString().slice(4) // ‚úÖ 
  }

  return formatDate()
}

getDate()
console.log(date) // ‚ùå Reference Error
```

Now let‚Äôs look at a more advanced example. Say we had an array of `prices` and we needed a function that took in that array as well as a `discount` and returned us a new array of discounted prices. The end goal might look something like this.

```js
discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) // [50, 100, 150]
```

And the implementation might look something like this

```js
function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
  var discounted = []

  for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
    var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
    discounted.push(finalPrice)
  }

  return discounted
}
```

Seems simple enough but what does this have to do with block scope? Take a look at that `for` loop. Are the variables declared inside of it accessible outside of it? Turns out, they are.

```js
function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
  var discounted = []

  for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
    var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
    discounted.push(finalPrice)
  }

  console.log(i) // 3
  console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
  console.log(finalPrice) // 150

  return discounted
}
```

If JavaScript is the only programming language you know, you may not think anything of this. However, if you‚Äôre coming to JavaScript from another programming language, specifically a programming language that is blocked scope, you‚Äôre probably a little bit concerned about what‚Äôs going on here. It‚Äôs not really broken, it‚Äôs just kind of weird. There‚Äôs not really a reason to still have access to `i`, `discountedPrice`, and `finalPrice` outside of the `for` loop. It doesn‚Äôt really do us any good and it may even cause us harm in some cases. However, since variables declared with `var` are function scoped, you do.

Now that we‚Äôve discussed variable declarations, initializations, and scope, the last thing we need to flush out before we dive into `let` and `const` is hoisting.

#### Hoisting

Remember earlier we said that ‚ÄúIn JavaScript, variables are initialized with the value of `undefined` when they are created.‚Äù. Turns out, that‚Äôs all that ‚ÄúHoisting‚Äù is. The JavaScript interpreter will assign variable declarations a default value of `undefined` during what‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúCreation‚Äù phase.

> For a much more in depth guide on the Creation Phase, Hoisting, and Scopes see [‚ÄúThe Ultimate Guide to Hoisting, Scopes, and Closures in JavaScript‚Äù](https://tylermcginnis.com/ultimate-guide-to-execution-contexts-hoisting-scopes-and-closures-in-javascript/)

Let‚Äôs take a look at the previous example and see how hoisting affects it.

```js
function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
  var discounted = undefined
  var i = undefined
  var discountedPrice = undefined
  var finalPrice = undefined

  discounted = []
  for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
    finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
    discounted.push(finalPrice)
  }

  console.log(i) // 3
  console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
  console.log(finalPrice) // 150

  return discounted
}
```

Notice all the variable declarations were assigned a default value of `undefined`. That‚Äôs why if you try access one of those variables **before** it was actually declared, you‚Äôll just get `undefined`.

```js
function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
  console.log(discounted) // undefined
  var discounted = []

  for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
    var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
    discounted.push(finalPrice)
  }

  console.log(i) // 3
  console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
  console.log(finalPrice) // 150

  return discounted
}
```

Now that you know everything there is to know about `var`, let‚Äôs finally talk about the whole point of why you‚Äôre here, what‚Äôs the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

#### var vs. let vs. const

First, let‚Äôs compare `var` and `let`. The main difference between `var` and `let` is that instead of being function scoped, `let` is block scoped. What that means is that a variable created with the `let` keyword is available inside the ‚Äúblock‚Äù that it was created in as well as any nested blocks. When I say ‚Äúblock‚Äù, I mean anything surrounded by a curly brace `{}` like in a `for` loop or an `if` statement.

So let‚Äôs look back to our `discountPrices` function one last time.

```js
function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
  var discounted = []

  for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
    var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
    discounted.push(finalPrice)
  }

  console.log(i) // 3  console.log(discountedPrice) // 150  console.log(finalPrice) // 150
  return discounted
}
```

Remember that we were able to log `i`, `discountedPrice`, and `finalPrice` outside of the `for` loop since they were declared with `var` and `var` is function scoped. But now, what happens if we change those `var` declarations to use `let` and try to run it?

```js
function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
  let discounted = []

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    let discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
    let finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
    discounted.push(finalPrice)
  }

  console.log(i) // 3  console.log(discountedPrice) // 150  console.log(finalPrice) // 150
  return discounted
}

discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5) // ‚ùå ReferenceError: i is not defined
```

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We get `ReferenceError: i is not defined`. What this tells us is that variables declared with `let` are block scoped, not function scoped. So trying to access `i` (or `discountedPrice` or `finalPrice`) outside of the ‚Äúblock‚Äù they were declared in is going to give us a reference error as we just barely saw.

```
var vs. let

var: function scoped

let: block scoped
```

The next difference has to do with Hoisting. Earlier we said that the definition of hoisting was ‚ÄúThe JavaScript interpreter will assign variable declarations a default value of `undefined` during what‚Äôs called the ‚ÄòCreation‚Äô phase.‚Äù We even saw this in action by logging a variable before it was declared (you get `undefined`)

```js
function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
  console.log(discounted) // undefined
  var discounted = []

  for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    var discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
    var finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
    discounted.push(finalPrice)
  }

  console.log(i) // 3
  console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
  console.log(finalPrice) // 150

  return discounted
}
```

I can‚Äôt think of any use case where you‚Äôd actually want to access a variable before it was declared. It seems like throwing a ReferenceError would be a better default than returning `undefined`. In fact, this is exactly what `let` does. If you try to access a variable declared with `let` before it‚Äôs declared, instead of getting `undefined` (like with those variables declared with `var`), you‚Äôll get a ReferenceError.

```js
function discountPrices (prices, discount) {
  console.log(discounted) // ‚ùå ReferenceError
  let discounted = []

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    let discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)
    let finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100
    discounted.push(finalPrice)
  }

  console.log(i) // 3
  console.log(discountedPrice) // 150
  console.log(finalPrice) // 150

  return discounted
}
var vs. let

var: 
  function scoped
  undefined when accessing a variable before it's declared

let: 
  block scoped
  ReferenceError when accessing a variable before it's declared
```

#### let vs. const

Now that you understand the difference between `var` and `let`, what about `const`? Turns out, `const` is almost exactly the same as `let`. However, the only difference is that once you‚Äôve assigned a value to a variable using `const`, you can‚Äôt reassign it to a new value.

```js
let name = 'Tyler'
const handle = 'tylermcginnis'

name = 'Tyler McGinnis' // ‚úÖ
handle = '@tylermcginnis' // ‚ùå TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

The take away above is that variables declared with `let` can be re-assigned, but variables declared with `const` can‚Äôt be.

Cool, so anytime you want a variable to be immutable, you can declare it with `const`. Well, not quite. Just because a variable is declared with `const` doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs immutable, all it means is the value can‚Äôt be re-assigned. Here‚Äôs a good example.

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Kim Kardashian'
}

person.name = 'Kim Kardashian West' // ‚úÖ

person = {} // ‚ùå Assignment to constant variable.
```

Notice that changing a property on an object isn‚Äôt reassigning it, so even though an object is declared with `const`, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt mutate any of its properties. It only means you can‚Äôt reassign it to a new value.

------

Now the most important question we haven‚Äôt answered yet, should you use `var`, `let`, or `const`? The most popular opinion, and the opinion that I subscribe to, is that you should always use `const` unless you know the variable is going to change. The reason for this is by using `const`, you‚Äôre signalling to your future self as well as any other future developers that have to read your code that this variable shouldn‚Äôt change. If it will need to change (like in a `for` loop), you should use `let`.

So between variables that change and variables that don‚Äôt change, there‚Äôs not much left. That means you shouldn‚Äôt ever have to use `var` again.

Now the unpopular opinion, though it still has some validity to it, is that you should never use `const` because even though you‚Äôre trying to signal that the variable is immutable, as we saw above, that‚Äôs not entirely the case. Developers who subscribe to this opinion always use `let` unless they have variables that are actually constants like `_LOCATION_ = ...`.

So to recap, `var` is function scoped and if you try to use a variable declared with `var` before the actual declaration, you‚Äôll just get `undefined`. `const` and `let` are blocked scoped and if you try to use variable declared with `let` or `const` before the declaration you‚Äôll get a ReferenceError. Finally the difference between `let` and `const` is that once you‚Äôve assigned a value to `const`, you can‚Äôt reassign it, but with `let`, you can.

```
