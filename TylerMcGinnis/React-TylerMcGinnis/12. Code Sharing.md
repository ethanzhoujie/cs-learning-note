### Higher Order Components

> There are two important things to note before we get started. First, what we‚Äôre going to talk about is just a pattern. It‚Äôs not even a React thing as much as it is a component architecture thing. Second, this isn‚Äôt required knowledge to build a React app. You could skip this post, never learn what we‚Äôre about to talk about, and still build fine React applications. However, just like building anything, the more tools you have available, the better the outcome will be. If you write React apps, you‚Äôd be doing yourself a disservice by not having this in your ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù.

You can‚Äôt get very far into studying software development before you hear the (almost cultish) mantra of `Don't Repeat Yourself` or `D.R.Y`. Sometimes it can be taken a bit too far, but for the most part, it‚Äôs a worthwhile goal. In this post, we‚Äôre going to look at the most popular pattern for accomplishing DRY in a React codebase, Higher-Order Components. However before we can explore the solution, we must first fully understand the problem.

Let‚Äôs say we were in charge of recreating a dashboard similar to Stripe‚Äôs. As most projects go, everything goes great until the very end. Just when you think you‚Äôre about to be done, you notice that the dashboard has a bunch of different tooltips that need to appear when certain elements are hovered over.

![GIF of Stripe's dashboard with lots of tooltips](./assets/tips.gif)

There are a few ways to approach this. The one you decide to go with is to detect the hover state of the individual components and from that state, show or not show the tooltip. There are three components you need to add this hover detection functionality to - `Info`, `TrendChart` and `DailyChart`.

Let‚Äôs start with `Info`. Right now it‚Äôs just a simple SVG icon.

```jsx
class Info extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <svg
        className="Icon-svg Icon--hoverable-svg"
        height={this.props.height}
        viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16">
          <path d="M9 8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H5.5a1 1 0 1 0 0 2H7v4a1 1 0 0 0 2 0zM4 0h8a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v8a4 4 0 0 1-4 4H4a4 4 0 0 1-4-4V4a4 4 0 0 1 4-4zm4 5.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3z" />
      </svg>
    )
  }
}
```

Now we need to add functionality to it so it can detect whether it‚Äôs being hovered over or not. We can use the `onMouseOver` and `onMouseOut` mouse events that come with React. The function we pass to `onMouseOver` will be invoked when the component is hovered over and the function we pass to `onMouseOut` will be invoked when the component is no longer being hovered over. To do this the React way, we‚Äôll add a `hovering` state property to our component so that we can cause a re-render when the `hovering` state changes, showing or hiding our tooltip.

```jsx
class Info extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='info' />
          : null}
        <svg
          className="Icon-svg Icon--hoverable-svg"
          height={this.props.height}
          viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16">
            <path d="M9 8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H5.5a1 1 0 1 0 0 2H7v4a1 1 0 0 0 2 0zM4 0h8a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v8a4 4 0 0 1-4 4H4a4 4 0 0 1-4-4V4a4 4 0 0 1 4-4zm4 5.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3z" />
        </svg>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Now we need to add the same functionality to our other two components, `TrendChart` and `DailyChart`. If it‚Äôs not broke, don‚Äôt fix it. Our hover logic for `Info` worked great so let‚Äôs use that same code again.

```jsx
class TrendChart extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='trend' />
          : null}
        <Chart type='trend' />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

You probably know the next step. We can do the same thing for our final `DailyChart` component.

```jsx
class DailyChart extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='daily' />
          : null}
        <Chart type='daily' />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

And with that, we‚Äôre all finished. You may have written React like this before. It‚Äôs not the end of the world (#shipit), but it‚Äôs not very ‚ÄúDRY‚Äù. As you saw, we‚Äôre repeating the exact same hover logic in every one of our components.

At this point, the **problem** should be pretty clear, **we want to avoid duplicating our hover logic anytime a new component needs it**. So what‚Äôs the **solution**? Well before we get to that, let‚Äôs talk about a few programming concepts that‚Äôll make the step to understanding the solution much easier, `callbacks` and `higher-order functions`.

In JavaScript, functions are ‚Äúfirst-class objects‚Äù. What that means is that just like objects/arrays/strings can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to a function, or returned from a function, so too can other functions.

```js
function add (x, y) {
  return x + y
}

function addFive (x, addReference) {
  return addReference(x, 5)
}

addFive(10, add) // 15
```

Your brain might have got a little weird on this one if you‚Äôre not used to it. We pass the `add` function as an argument to the `addFive` function, rename it `addReference`, and then we invoke it.

When you do this, the function you‚Äôre passing as an argument is called a **callback** function and the function you‚Äôre passing the callback function to is called a **higher-order function**.

Because vocabulary is important, here‚Äôs the same code with the variables re-named to match the concepts they‚Äôre demonstrating.

```js
function add (x,y) {
  return x + y
}

function higherOrderFunction (x, callback) {
  return callback(x, 5)
}

higherOrderFunction(10, add)
```

This pattern should look familiar; it‚Äôs everywhere. If you‚Äôve ever used any of the JavaScript Array methods, jQuery, or a library like lodash, you‚Äôve used both higher-order functions and callbacks.

```js
[1,2,3].map((i) => i + 5)

_.filter([1,2,3,4], (n) => n % 2 === 0 );

$('#btn').on('click', () =>
  console.log('Callbacks are everywhere')
)
```

Let‚Äôs go back to our example. What if instead of just creating an `addFive` function, we also wanted an `addTen` function, `addTwenty` function, etc. With our current implementation, we‚Äôd have to duplicate a lot of our logic whenever we needed a new function.

```js
function add (x, y) {
  return x + y
}

function addFive (x, addReference) {  return addReference(x, 5)}
function addTen (x, addReference) {  return addReference(x, 10)}
function addTwenty (x, addReference) {  return addReference(x, 20)}
addFive(10, add) // 15
addTen(10, add) // 20
addTwenty(10, add) // 30
```

Again, this isn‚Äôt terrible, but we‚Äôre repeating a lot of the same logic. The goal here is to be able to create as many ‚Äúadder‚Äù functions (`addFive`, `addTen`, `addTwenty`, etc) as we need while minimizing code duplication. To accomplish this, what if we create a `makeAdder` function? This function can take in a number and a reference to the original `add` function. Because the goal of this function is to make a new adder function, we can have it return a brand new function that accepts the number to add. That was a lot of words. Let‚Äôs see some code.

```js
function add (x, y) {
  return x + y
}

function makeAdder (x, addReference) {
  return function (y) {
    return addReference(x, y)
  }
}

const addFive = makeAdder(5, add)
const addTen = makeAdder(10, add)
const addTwenty = makeAdder(20, add)

addFive(10) // 15
addTen(10) // 20
addTwenty(10) // 30
```

Cool. Now we can make as many ‚Äúadder‚Äù functions as we need while minimizing the duplicate code we have to write.

> If you care, this concept of having a function with multiple parameters return a new function with fewer parameters is called ‚ÄúPartial Application‚Äù and it‚Äôs a functional programming technique. JavaScript‚Äôs ‚Äú.bind‚Äù method is a common example of this.

Alright, but what does this have to do with React and the problem we saw earlier of duplicating our hover logic anytime a new component needs it? Well just as creating our `makeAdder` higher-order function allowed us to minimize code duplication, so too can making a similar ‚Äúhigher-order component‚Äù help us in the same way. However, instead of the higher-order function returning a new function that invokes the callback, the higher-order component can return a new component that renders the ‚Äúcallback‚Äù component ü§Ø. That was a lot. Let‚Äôs break it down.

#### (Our) Higher-Order Function

- Is a function
- Takes in a callback function as an argument
- Returns a new function
- The function it returns can invoke the original callback function that was passed in

```js
function higherOrderFunction (callback) {
  return function () {
    return callback()
  }
}
```

#### (Our) Higher-Order Component

- Is a component
- Takes in a component as an argument
- Returns a new component
- The component it returns can render the original component that was passed in

```jsx
function higherOrderComponent (Component) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <Component />
    }
  }
}
```

So now that we have the basic idea of what a higher-order component does, let‚Äôs start building ours out. If you‚Äôll remember, the problem earlier was that we were duplicating all of our hover logic amongst all of the component that needed that functionality.

```jsx
state = { hovering: false }
mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
```

With that in mind, we want our higher-order component (which we‚Äôll call `withHover`) to be able to encapsulate that hover logic in itself and then pass the `hovering` state to the component that it renders. That will allow us to prevent duplicating all the hover logic and instead, put it into a single location (`withHover`).

Ultimately, here‚Äôs the end goal. Whenever we want a component that is aware of it‚Äôs `hovering` state, we can pass the original component to our `withHover` higher-order component.

```js
const InfoWithHover = withHover(Info)
const TrendChartWithHover = withHover(TrendChart)
const DailyChartWithHover = withHover(DailyChart)
```

Then, whenever any of the components that `withHover` returns are rendered, they‚Äôll render the original component, passing it a `hovering` prop.

```jsx
function Info ({ hovering, height }) {
  return (
    <>
      {hovering === true
        ? <Tooltip id='info' />
        : null}
      <svg
        className="Icon-svg Icon--hoverable-svg"
        height={height}
        viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16">
          <path d="M9 8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H5.5a1 1 0 1 0 0 2H7v4a1 1 0 0 0 2 0zM4 0h8a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v8a4 4 0 0 1-4 4H4a4 4 0 0 1-4-4V4a4 4 0 0 1 4-4zm4 5.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3z" />
      </svg>
    </>
  )
}
```

Now the last thing we need to do is actually implement `withHover`. As we saw above, it needs to do three things.

- Take in a ‚ÄúComponent‚Äù argument.
- Return a new component
- Render the ‚ÄúComponent‚Äù argument passing it a ‚Äúhovering‚Äù prop.

#### Take in a ‚ÄúComponent‚Äù argument.

```js
function withHover (Component) {

}
```

#### Return a new component

```js
function withHover (Component) {
  return class WithHover extends React.Component {

  }
}
```

#### Render the ‚ÄúComponent‚Äù argument passing it a ‚Äúhovering‚Äù prop.

Now the question becomes, how do we get the `hovering` state? Well, we already have the code for that that we build earlier. We just need to add it to the new component and then pass the `hovering` state as a prop when we render the argument `Component`.

```jsx
function withHover(Component) {
  return class WithHover extends React.Component {
    state = { hovering: false }
    mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
    mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
    render() {
      return (
        <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
          <Component hovering={this.state.hovering} />
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
}
```

The way I like to think about it (and how it‚Äôs mentioned in the React docs) is **a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.** In our case, we‚Äôre transforming our `Info`, `TrendChart`, and `DailyChart` components into new components which are aware of their hover state via a `hovering` prop.

------

At this point, we‚Äôve covered all of the fundamentals of Higher-Order Components. There are still a few more important items to discuss though.

If you look back at our `withHover` HOC, one weakness it has is it assumes that the consumer of it is fine with receiving a prop named `hovering`. For the most part this is probably fine but there are certain use cases where it wouldn‚Äôt be. For example, what if the component already had a prop named `hovering`? We‚Äôd have a naming collision. One change we can make is to allow the consumer of our `withHover` HOC to specify what they want the name of the hovering state to be when it‚Äôs passed to their component as a prop. Because `withHover` is just a function, let‚Äôs change it up to accept a second argument which specifies the name of the prop that we‚Äôll pass to the component.

```
function withHover(Component, propName = 'hovering') {  return class WithHover extends React.Component {    state = { hovering: false }    mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })    mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })    render() {      const props = {        [propName]: this.state.hovering      }      return (        <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>          <Component {...props} />        </div>      );    }  } } 
```

Now we‚Äôve set the default prop name to `hovering` (via ES6‚Äôs default parameters), but if the consumer of `withHover` wants to change that, they can by passing in the new prop name as the second argument.

```jsx
function withHover(Component, propName = 'hovering') {
  return class WithHover extends React.Component {
    state = { hovering: false }
    mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
    mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
    render() {
      const props = {
        [propName]: this.state.hovering
      }

      return (
        <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
          <Component {...props} />
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
}

function Info ({ showTooltip, height }) {  return (
    <>
      {showTooltip === true        ? <Tooltip id='info' />
        : null}
      <svg
        className="Icon-svg Icon--hoverable-svg"
        height={height}
        viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16">
          <path d="M9 8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H5.5a1 1 0 1 0 0 2H7v4a1 1 0 0 0 2 0zM4 0h8a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v8a4 4 0 0 1-4 4H4a4 4 0 0 1-4-4V4a4 4 0 0 1 4-4zm4 5.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3z" />
      </svg>
    </>
  )
}

const InfoWithHover = withHover(Info, 'showTooltip')
```

------

You may have noticed another problem with our `withHover` implementation as well. Looking at our `Info` component, you‚Äôll notice that it should also take in a `height` property. With the current way we‚Äôve set it up, `height` is going to be undefined. The reason for that is because our `withHover` component is the one rendering the `Component`. Currently, how we‚Äôve set it up, we‚Äôre not passing any props to `<Component />` besides the `hovering` prop that we created.

```jsx
const InfoWithHover = withHover(Info)

...

return <InfoWithHover height="16px" />
```

The `height` prop gets passed to the `InfoWithHover` component. But what exactly is that component? It‚Äôs the component that we‚Äôre returning from `withHover`.

```jsx
function withHover(Component, propName = 'hovering') {
  return class WithHover extends React.Component {    state = { hovering: false }    mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })    mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })    render() {      console.log(this.props) // { height: "16px" }      const props = {        [propName]: this.state.hovering      }      return (        <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>          <Component {...props} />        </div>      );    }  }}
```

Inside of the `WithHover` component `this.props.height` is `16px` but from there we don‚Äôt do anything with it. We need to make sure that we pass that through to the `Component` argument that we‚Äôre rendering.

```jsx
    render() {
      const props = {
        [propName]: this.state.hovering,
        ...this.props,      }

      return (
        <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
          <Component {...props} />
        </div>
      );
    }
```

------

At this point, we‚Äôve seen the benefits of using Higher-Order Components to reuse component logic amongst various components without duplicating code. But, does it have any pitfalls? It does, and we‚Äôve already seen it.

When using a HOC, there‚Äôs an [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) happening. Imagine we were using a third part HOC like React Router‚Äôs `withRouter` HOC. According to their docs, "`withRouter` will pass `match`, `location`, and `history` props to the wrapped component whenever it renders."

```js
class Game extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { match, location, history } = this.props // From React Router

    ...
  }
}

export default withRouter(Game)
```

Notice we‚Äôre not the ones creating the `Game` element (i.e. `<Game />`). We‚Äôre handing over our component entirely to React Router and we‚Äôre trusting them to not only render it but also pass it the correct props. We saw this problem earlier when we talked about naming collisions with `hovering`. To fix that we decided to let the consumer of our `withHover` HOC pass in a second argument to configure what the prop name was going to be. With the 3rd party `withRouter` HOC, we don‚Äôt have that option. If our `Game` component is already using `match`, `location`, or `history`, we‚Äôre out of luck. We‚Äôd either have to modify those names in our component or we‚Äôd have to stop using the `withRouter` HOC.











### Render Props

> This post starts off the same as the ‚ÄúReact Higher-order Components‚Äù section but soon changes to be Render Props focused.

> There‚Äôs two important things to note before we get started. First, what we‚Äôre going to talk about is just a pattern. It‚Äôs not really even a React thing as much as it is a component architecture thing. Second, this isn‚Äôt required knowledge to build a React app. You could skip this post, never learn what we‚Äôre about to talk about, and still build fine React applications. However, just like building anything, the more tools you have available the better the outcome will be. If you write React apps, you‚Äôd be doing yourself a disservice by not having this in your ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù.

You can‚Äôt get very far into studying software development before you hear the (almost cultish) mantra of `Don't Repeat Yourself` or `D.R.Y`. Sometimes it can be taken a bit too far, but for the most part, it‚Äôs a worthwhile goal. In this post we‚Äôre going to look at a pattern for accomplishing DRY in a React codebase, React Render Props. However before we can explore the solution, we must first fully understand the problem.

Let‚Äôs say we were in charge of recreating a dashboard similar to Stripe‚Äôs. As most projects go, everything goes great until the very end. Just when you think you‚Äôre about to be done, you notice that the dashboard has a bunch of different tooltips that need to appear when certain elements are hovered over.

![GIF of Stripe's dashboard with lots of tooltips](./assets/tool-tips.gif)

There are a few ways to approach this. The one you decide to go with is to detect the hover state of the individual components and from that state, show or not show the tooltip. There are three components you need to add this hover detection functionality to - `Info`, `TrendChart` and `DailyChart`.

Let‚Äôs start with `Info`. Right now it‚Äôs just a simple SVG icon.

```jsx
class Info extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <svg
        className="Icon-svg Icon--hoverable-svg"
        height={this.props.height}
        viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16">
          <path d="M9 8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H5.5a1 1 0 1 0 0 2H7v4a1 1 0 0 0 2 0zM4 0h8a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v8a4 4 0 0 1-4 4H4a4 4 0 0 1-4-4V4a4 4 0 0 1 4-4zm4 5.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3z" />
      </svg>
    )
  }
}
```

Now we need to add functionality to it so it can detect whether it‚Äôs being hovered over or not. We can use the `onMouseOver` and `onMouseOut` mouse events that come with React. The function we pass to `onMouseOver` will be invoked when the component is hovered over and the function we pass to `onMouseOut` will be invoked when the component is no longer being hovered over. To do this the React way, we‚Äôll add a `hovering` state property to our component so that we can cause a re-render when the `hovering` state changes, showing or hiding our tooltip.

```jsx
class Info extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='info' />
          : null}
        <svg
          className="Icon-svg Icon--hoverable-svg"
          height={this.props.height}
          viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16">
            <path d="M9 8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H5.5a1 1 0 1 0 0 2H7v4a1 1 0 0 0 2 0zM4 0h8a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v8a4 4 0 0 1-4 4H4a4 4 0 0 1-4-4V4a4 4 0 0 1 4-4zm4 5.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3z" />
        </svg>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Looking good. Now we need to add the same functionality to our other two components, `TrendChart` and `DailyChart`. If it‚Äôs not broke, don‚Äôt fix it. Our hover logic for `Info` worked great so let‚Äôs use that same code again.

```jsx
class TrendChart extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='trend' />
          : null}
        <Chart type='trend' />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

You probably know the next step. We can do the same thing for our final `DailyChart` component.

```jsx
class DailyChart extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='daily' />
          : null}
        <Chart type='daily' />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

And with that, we‚Äôre all finished. You may have written React like this before. It‚Äôs not the end of the world (#shipit), but it‚Äôs not very ‚ÄúDRY‚Äù. As you saw, we‚Äôre repeating the exact same hover logic in every one of our components.

At this point, the **problem** should be pretty clear, **we want to avoid duplicating our hover logic anytime a new component needs it**. So what‚Äôs the **solution**? Well before we get to that, we need to get a refresh on two fundamental aspects of React. They are components which don‚Äôt render UI and passing functions as props.

#### No UI Components

In most cases whenever you build a React component, the end goal is to show some UI to the screen.

```js
View = fn(state)
```

However, that doesn‚Äôt always need to be the case. It‚Äôs entirely reasonable to have components which act as ‚ÄúWrapper‚Äù components. They‚Äôre responsible for handling some logic but instead of rendering their own UI, they just render another component passing it data.

```jsx
class Users extends React.Component {
  state = {
    users: null
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    getUsers()
      .then((users) => {
        this.setState({ users })
      })
  }
  render() {
    <Grid data={this.state.users} />
  }
}
```

In the example above `Users` is responsible for getting the users, then passing them to the `Grid` component. It doesn‚Äôt have its own UI, instead, it uses the UI from the `Grid` component.

#### Passing functions as props

As you know, props are part of React‚Äôs component API that allow you to pass data into a component.

```jsx
<User id='tylermcginnis' />
```

Then inside of the `User` component, the `props` object would have an `id` property referencing the string `tylermcginnis`.

```js
function User (props) {
  const id = props.id // tylermcginnis
}
```

Now what if instead of passing a string as a prop, we passed a function?

```jsx
<User id={() => 'tylermcginnis'} />
```

Now the `props` object still has an `id` property, only now instead of being a string, it references a function. So in order to get the id, we need to invoke the function.

```js
function User (props) {
  const id = props.id() // tylermcginnis
}
```

Now what if we wanted to pass the function prop some data? Well, it‚Äôs just a function so we could do it just like we normally would by passing it an argument.

```js
function User (props) {
  const id = props.id(true) // tylermcginnis
}

<User id={(isAuthed) => isAuthed === true ? 'tylermcginnis' : null} />
```

------

OK‚Ä¶ but what do both of these have to do with the problem we saw earlier of duplicating our hover logic anytime a new component needs it? Well we can combine both of these simple concepts in order to solve our problem.

First, we want to create a ‚ÄúWrapper‚Äù component which is responsible for managing the hover state. We‚Äôll call it, naturally, `Hover` and it‚Äôll contain all the hover logic that we had to duplicate from earlier.

```jsx
class Hover extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>

      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

The next question becomes what should `Hover` render? This is where our function prop knowledge comes into play. Let‚Äôs have `Hover` receive a prop called `render`. This `render` prop is going to be a function that we can pass the `hovering` state to and it will return some UI.

```jsx
<Hover render={(hovering) =>
  <div>
    Is hovering? {hovering === true ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
  <div>
} />
```

Now the last change we need to make is in our `Hover` component. All we need to do is invoke `this.props.render` passing it `this.state.hover`.

```jsx
class Hover extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.props.render(this.state.hovering)}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Well would you look at that. Now that we have our `Hover` component, any time we need a component to be aware of its hover state, we just wrap it inside of a `Hover`s `render` prop.

Finally let‚Äôs head back to the original code we had and see how we no longer have to duplicate all the hover logic since we have our `Hover` component.

This is what we had before.

```jsx
class Info extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='info' />
          : null}
        <svg
          className="Icon-svg Icon--hoverable-svg"
          height={this.props.height}
          viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16">
            <path d="M9 8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H5.5a1 1 0 1 0 0 2H7v4a1 1 0 0 0 2 0zM4 0h8a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v8a4 4 0 0 1-4 4H4a4 4 0 0 1-4-4V4a4 4 0 0 1 4-4zm4 5.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3z" />
        </svg>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class TrendChart extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='trend' />
          : null}
        <Chart type='trend' />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class DailyChart extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.state.hovering === true
          ? <Tooltip id='daily' />
          : null}
        <Chart type='daily' />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

function App () {
  return (
    <>
      <Info />
      <TrendChart />
      <DailyChart />
    </>
  )
}
```

And now with our `Hover` component, instead of each component having to duplicate the hover logic, we can wrap each one inside of the `render` prop we pass to `Hover` and then pass down the `hovering` argument as a prop.

```jsx
function Info (props) {
  return (
    <>
      {props.hovering === true
        ? <Tooltip id='info' />
        : null}
      <svg
        className="Icon-svg Icon--hoverable-svg"
        height={props.height}
        viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16">
          <path d="M9 8a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H5.5a1 1 0 1 0 0 2H7v4a1 1 0 0 0 2 0zM4 0h8a4 4 0 0 1 4 4v8a4 4 0 0 1-4 4H4a4 4 0 0 1-4-4V4a4 4 0 0 1 4-4zm4 5.5a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 3z" />
      </svg>
    </>
  )
}

function TrendChart (props) {
  return (
    <>
      {props.hovering === true
        ? <Tooltip id='trend' />
        : null}
      <Chart type='trend' />
    </>
  )
}


function DailyChart (props) {
  return (
    <>
      {props.hovering === true
        ? <Tooltip id='daily' />
        : null}
      <Chart type='daily' />
    </>
  )
}

function App () {
  return (
    <>
      <Hover render={(hovering) =>
        <Info hovering={hovering} />
      }/>

      <Hover render={(hovering) =>
        <TrendChart hovering={hovering} />
      }/>

      <Hover render={(hovering) =>
        <DailyChart hovering={hovering} />
      }/>
    </>
  )
}
```

This pattern, as you probably guessed by now, is called `Render Props`. Summarized in the React docs, ‚Äúthe term render prop refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function‚Äù.

------

Another way to utilize the render props pattern is with React‚Äôs `children` prop. If you‚Äôve never used `props.children` before, it‚Äôs just like any other prop, except instead of you passing it explicitly to the component, React automatically does it for you and it reference whatever is in the body of the component.

```js
function User (props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  )
}

<User>
  This is props.children
</User>
```

In the example above, what‚Äôs going to get rendered to the UI is a `div` with the words `This is props.children` inside of it.

Now what if instead of having `props.children` be a string, it was a function? Just as we saw earlier, we‚Äôd need to invoke it to get the value.

```jsx
function User (props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.children()}    </div>
  )
}

<User>
  {() => This is props.children}</User>
```

With our newly formed knowledge of `props.children`, let‚Äôs update our examples from earlier. Now instead of `Hover` having a `render` prop, let‚Äôs get rid of that all together and use `props.children` instead.

```jsx
function App () {
  return (
    <>
      <Hover>
        {(hovering) => <Info hovering={hovering} />}
      </Hover>

      <Hover>
        {(hovering) => <TrendChart hovering={hovering} />}
      </Hover>

      <Hover>
        {(hovering) => <DailyChart hovering={hovering} />}
      </Hover>
    </>
  )
}
```

Looks good. Now we need to update `Hover` so instead of invoking `this.props.render`, it invokes `this.props.children`.

```js
class Hover extends React.Component {
  state = { hovering: false }
  mouseOver = () => this.setState({ hovering: true })
  mouseOut = () => this.setState({ hovering: false })
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseOver={this.mouseOver} onMouseOut={this.mouseOut}>
        {this.props.children(this.state.hovering)}      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Nice. Is this better? Not really, it‚Äôs just different. I prefer it, but there‚Äôs nothing objectively better about it.

------

If you read our post about [Higher Order Components](https://ui.dev/react-higher-order-components/), you‚Äôll be familiar with how HOCs have some pitfalls. The biggest one was with inversion of control and naming collisions. Because you have to pass your component over to the Higher-Order component, you have no control over how it‚Äôs rendered. We looked at an example with React Router‚Äôs `withRouter` HOC. `withRouter` will pass `match`, `location`, and `history` props to the wrapped component whenever it renders.

```js
class Game extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { match, location, history } = this.props // From React Router

    ...
  }
}

export default withRouter(Game)
```

If our Game component is already receiving `match`, `location`, or `history` as a prop, we‚Äôre going to have a naming collision and it‚Äôs going to be a hard bug to track down.

Does this same pitfall occur with Render Props? Nope. Instead of handing over the component, we hand over a function. Then, when that function is invoked, it‚Äôll be passed the data we need. No inversion of control and no naming collisions since we can decide how the component is rendered.

```jsx
<Hover>
  {(hovering) => {
    // We can do whatever we want here.
    // We decide how and when to render the component
    return <Info anyNameWeWant={hovering} />
  }}
</Hover>
```

------

Now the big question is, should you use Render Props or Higher Order Components? Well, that‚Äôs up to you. You now know how to use them both which means you have enough information to make an informed decision for yourself.
