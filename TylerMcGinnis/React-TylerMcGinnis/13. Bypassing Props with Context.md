### React Context

Whenever you‚Äôre utilizing a component architecture, as your application grows, the ability to share state amongst different components will inevitably become an issue.

Let‚Äôs pretend we had an app with the following architecture, each circle representing a different component.

Now let‚Äôs pretend that we had a piece of state that was needed throughout various levels of our application

The recommended solution for this problem is to move that state up to the nearest parent component and then pass it down via props.

This works, and most of the time it‚Äôs the right solution. However, there are times when passing props through intermediate components can become overly redundant or downright unmanageable. Take a tool like React Router for example. React Router needs to have the ability to pass routing props to any component in the component tree, regardless of how deeply nested the components are. Because this is such a significant problem, React comes with a built-in API to solve it called Context.

> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. - The React Docs

Now that we know the problem that Context solves, how do we use it?

#### The Context API

For our example, let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre building an app that is used by both English and Spanish speaking countries. We want to expose a button that when it‚Äôs clicked, can toggle the text of our entire application between English and Spanish.

From a high level, if you think about what‚Äôs needed to solve this problem, there are two aspects to it.

1. We need a way to declare the data that we want available throughout our component tree. In our example, that data is a `locale` value that will be either `en` or `es`.
2. We need a way for any component in the component tree that requires that data to be able to subscribe to it.

React gives us the ability to do both of those things whenever we create a new Context using the `React.createContext` method.

> Typically, you create a new Context for each unique piece of data that needs to be available throughout your component tree. Based on our example, we‚Äôll create a `LocaleContext`.

```js
const LocaleContext = React.createContext()
```

Now if we examine our `LocaleContext`, you‚Äôll notice that it has two properties, both of which are React components, `Provider`, and `Consumer`.

`Provider` allows us to ‚Äúdeclare the data that we want available throughout our component tree‚Äù.

`Consumer` allows ‚Äúany component in the component tree that needs that data to be able to subscribe to it‚Äù.

#### Provider

You use `Provider` just like you would any other React component. It accepts a `value` prop which is the data that you want available to any of its `children` who need to consume it.

```jsx
<MyContext.Provider value={data}>
  <App />
</MyContext.Provider>
```

In our example, we want `locale` to be available anywhere in the component tree. We also want to update the UI (re-render) whenever it changes, so we‚Äôll stick it on our component‚Äôs state.

```js
// LocaleContext.js
import React from "react"

const LocaleContext = React.createContext()

export default LocaleContext
import React from 'react'
import LocaleContext from './LocaleContext'

class App extends React.Component { 
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      locale: 'en'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <LocaleContext.Provider value={this.state.locale}>
        <Home />
      </LocaleContext.Provider>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

Now, any component in our component tree that needs the value of `locale` will have the option to subscribe to it using `LocaleContext.Consumer`.

#### Consumer

Again, the whole point of the `Consumer` component is it allows you to get access to the data that was passed as a `value` prop to the Context‚Äôs `Provider` component. To do this, `Consumer` uses a [render prop](https://ui.dev/react-render-props/).

```jsx
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {(data) => {
    return (
      <h1>
        The "value" prop passed to "Provider" was {data}
      </h1>
    )
  }}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```

Now in our example, because we passed `this.state.locale` as the `value` prop to `LocaleContext.Provider`, we can get access to it by passing `LocaleContext.Consumer` a render prop.

```jsx
// Blog.js
import React from 'react'
import LocaleContext from './LocaleContext'

export default function Blog () {
  return (
    <LocaleContext.Consumer>
      {(locale) => <Posts locale={locale} />}
    </LocaleContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```

#### Updating Context State

At this point, we‚Äôve seen that because we wrapped our whole app in `<LocaleContext.Provider value={this.state.locale}>`, any component in our application tree can get access to `locale` by using `LocaleContext.Consumer`. However, getting access to `locale` isn‚Äôt enough. We also want to be able to toggle it (`en` -> `es`) from anywhere inside of our component tree. So just as we did with `this.state.locale`, we‚Äôll add a new property to the `value` prop of `LocaleContext.Provider`.

Your first intuition might be to do something like this.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component { 
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      locale: 'en'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <LocaleContext.Provider 
        value={{
          locale: this.state.locale,
          toggleLocale: : () => {
            this.setState(({ locale }) => ({
              locale: locale === "en" ? "es" : "en"
            }));
          }
        }}>
          <Home />
      </LocaleContext.Provider>
    )
  }
}
```

So what we‚Äôve done is added a new property to the object we pass to `value`. Now, anywhere in our component tree, using `LocaleContext.Consumer`, we can grab `locale` OR `toggleLocale`.

Sadly, the idea is right, but the execution is wrong. Can you think of any downsides to this approach? Hint, it has to do with performance.

Just like React re-renders with prop changes, whenever the data passed to `value` changes, React will re-render every component which used `Consumer` to subscribe to that data. The way in which React knows if the data changes is by using ‚Äúreference identity‚Äù (which is kind of a fancy way of saving `oldObject` === `newObject`).

Currently, how we have it set up (`value={{}}`), we‚Äôre passing a **new** object to `value` every time that `App` re-renders. What this means is that when React checks if the data passed to `value` has changed, it‚Äôll always think it has since we‚Äôre always passing in a new object. As a result of that, every component which used `Consumer` to subscribe to that data will re-render as well, even if nothing changed.

To fix this, instead of passing a **new** object to `value` every time, we want to give it a reference to an object it already knows about. Though it may look weird, our `state` object fits this need perfectly.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component { 
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      locale: 'en',
      toggleLocale: () => {
        this.setState(({ locale }) => ({
          locale: locale === "en" ? "es" : "en"
        }));
      }
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <LocaleContext.Provider value={this.state}>
        <Home />
      </LocaleContext.Provider>
    )
  }
}
```

Now, anywhere inside of our component tree, we can get access to the `locale` value or the ability to change it via `toggleLocale`.

```jsx
// Blog.js
import React from 'react'
import LocaleContext from './LocaleContext'

export default function Blog () {
  return (
    <LocaleContext.Consumer>
      {({ locale, toggleLocale }) => (
        <React.Fragment>
          <Nav toggleLocal={toggleLocale} />
          <Posts locale={locale} />
        </React.Fragment>
      )}
    </LocaleContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```

[Here‚Äôs the link](https://codesandbox.io/s/7w87y6knj) to the full `locale` app if you want to play around with it. Admittedly, it‚Äôs not the best use of Context as it‚Äôs a pretty shallow app, but it gives you the general idea how to use Context in an app with multiple routes/components.

------

#### defaultValue

Whenever you render a `Consumer` component, it gets its value from the `value` prop of the nearest `Provider` component of the same Context object. However, what if there isn‚Äôt a parent `Provider` of the same Context object? In that case, it‚Äôll get its value from the first argument that was passed to `createContext` when the Context object was created.

```js
const MyContext = React.creatContext('defaultValue')
```

And adapted to our example.

```js
const LocaleContext = React.createContext('en')
```

Now, if we use `<LocaleContext.Consumer>` without previously rendering a `<LocaleContext.Provider>`, the value passed to `Consumer` will be `en`.

Here‚Äôs a very clever example my good friend [chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic/status/979480237279928320) came up with. I‚Äôve modified it a bit, but the core idea is his.

[Here‚Äôs a live version you can play around with](https://codepen.io/tylermcginnis/pen/mgddmL).

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

const ExpletiveContext = React.createContext('shit')

function ContextualExclamation () {
  return (
    <ExpletiveContext.Consumer>
      {(word ) => <span>Oh {word}!</span>}
    </ExpletiveContext.Consumer>
  )
}

function VisitGrandmasHouse () {
  return (
    <ExpletiveContext.Provider value='poop'>
      <h1>Grandma's House üè°</h1>
      <ContextualExclamation />
    </ExpletiveContext.Provider>
  )
}

function VisitFriendsHouse () {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Friend's House üèö</h1>
      <ContextualExclamation />
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}

function App () {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <VisitFriendsHouse />
      <VisitGrandmasHouse />
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}
```

Can you follow what‚Äôs going on? First, we create a new `ExpletiveContext` and set its default value to `shit`. Then we render two components, `VisitFriendsHouse` and `VisitGrandmasHouse`.

Because we‚Äôre allowed to swear at our friend‚Äôs house, `VisitFriendsHouse` renders `ExpletiveContext.Consumer` whose value will default to `shit` since there‚Äôs not a `ExpletiveContext.Provider` in the tree above it.

Unlike at our friends, with Grandma, we‚Äôre not allowed to swear. So instead of just rendering `ExpletiveContext.Consumer`, we wrap it in `ExpletiveContext.Provider` passing it a value of `poop`. This way when the `Consumer` looks for its nearest `Provider`, it‚Äôll find it and get a value of `poop` rather than the default value of `shit`.

#### Warnings

Here‚Äôs the thing, when you‚Äôre a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Typically when you first learn about Context, it appears like it‚Äôs the solution to all your problems. Just remember, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with passing props down multiple levels, that‚Äôs literally how React was designed. I don‚Äôt have a universal rule for when you should and shouldn‚Äôt use Context, just be mindful that it‚Äôs common to overuse it.
