### Building React Apps for Production

If I had a dollar for every time I’ve seen someone post “slow” React benchmarks only to find later that React was running in development mode rather than in production, I’d have like, 6 dollars. Turns out, React in development mode is significantly larger and slower than React in production (because it includes a bunch of helpful things like warnings that you don’t need in production). Before you ever deploy your React app, it’s vital that you add a build step to build React in production. In this post, we’ll learn how to do that with Create React App as well as our own custom Webpack build.

### Create React App

```bash
npm run build
```

That’s it 🤷‍♂️. That command will create you a `build` directory with a production build of your app. You can then take that `build` directory and deploy it to production.

### Custom Webpack Build

There’s one critical step when creating a production build with React and Webpack. You need to tell Webpack to run in `production` mode. This will do a few things. First, it’ll let Webpack know that it should minify your code. Second, it’ll set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `production`. This is React’s signal to only include what is absolutely necessary to run the app (removing things like warnings, PropTypes, etc.).

Now the question is, how do you do that? All you need to do is add a `mode` property to your Webpack config and set it to `production`.

```js
mode: 'production'
```

And that’s it! Well, not quite. Now your app will always run in `production` mode, even when you’re developing. Ideally what we want to do is have different commands we can run based on the mode we want to run in. Something like this.

##### For development

```bash
npm run start
```

##### For Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

To update our NPM scripts, we’ll need to update our `package.json` file.

```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack-dev-server",
  "build": "NODE_ENV='production' webpack",
},
```

> Windows users, use this instead: `"SET NODE_ENV='production' && webpack"`

Now, because we included `NODE_ENV='production'` when we run `npm run build`, inside of our Webpack config, `process.env.NODE_ENV` will be set to production. We can then use that to decide if Webpack should be in `production` or `development` mode.

```js
// webpack.config.js

...

mode: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'production' : 'development',

...
```
