### (Bonus) React Interview Questions

*For the record, asking someone these questions probably isn’t the best way to get a deep understanding of their experience with React. **React Interview Questions** just seemed like a better title than **Things you may or may not need to know in React, but you may find helpful none the less**.*

------

> What happens when you call **setState**?

The first thing React will do when setState is called is merge the object you passed into setState into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on this new state. To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this tree, to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree. By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where necessary.

------

> What’s the difference between an **Element** and a **Component** in React?

Simply put, a React element describes what you want to see on the screen. Not so simply put, a React element is an object representation of some UI.

A React component is a function or a class which optionally accepts input and returns a React element (typically via JSX which gets compiled to a `createElement` invocation).

For more info, check out [React Elements vs React Components](https://ui.dev/react-elements-vs-react-components/)

------

> When would you use a **Class Component** over a **Functional Component**?

If your component has state or a lifecycle method(s), use a Class component (or Hooks). Otherwise, use a Functional component.

------

> What are **refs** in React and why are they important?

Refs are an escape hatch which allow you to get direct access to a DOM element or an instance of a component. To use them you add a ref attribute to your component whose value is a callback function which will receive the underlying DOM element or the mounted instance of the component as its first argument.

```jsx
class UnControlledForm extends Component {
  input = React.createRef()
  handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log("Input Value: ", this.input.current.value)
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          ref={this.input} />
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

------

> What are **keys** in React and why are they important?

Keys are what help React keep track of what items have changed, been added, or been removed from a list.

```jsx
function List ({ todos }) {
  return (
    <ul>
       {todos.map(({ task, id} ) => <li key={id}>{task}</li>}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

It’s important that each key be unique among siblings. We’ve talked a few times already about reconciliation and part of this reconciliation process is performing a diff of the new element tree with the most previous one. Keys make this process more efficient when dealing with lists because React can use the key on a child element to quickly know if an element is new or if it was just moved when comparing trees. And not only do keys make this process more efficient but without keys, React can’t know which local state corresponds to which item on move. So never neglect keys when mapping.

------

> If you created a React element like **Twitter** below, what would the component definition of **Twitter** look like?

```jsx
<Twitter username='tylermcginnis'>
  {(user) => user === null
    ? <Loading />
    : <Badge info={user} />}
</Twitter>
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react'
import fetchUser from 'twitter'
// fetchUser take in a username returns a promise
// which will resolve with that username's data.

class Twitter extends Component {
  // finish this
}
```

If you’re not familiar with the *render props* pattern, this will look a little strange. In this pattern, a component receives a function as its child. Take notice of what’s inside the opening and closing `<Twitter>` tags above. Instead of another component as you’ve probably seen before, the *Twitter* component’s child is a function. What this means is that in the implementation of the *Twitter* component, we’ll need to treat *props.children* as a function.

Here’s how I went about solving it.

```jsx
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react'
import fetchUser from 'twitter'

class Twitter extends Component {
  state = {
    user: null,
  }
  static propTypes = {
    username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  }
  componentDidMount () {
    fetchUser(this.props.username)
      .then((user) => this.setState({user}))
  }
  render () {
    return this.props.children(this.state.user)
  }
}
```

Notice that, just as I mentioned above, I treat *props.children* as a function by invoking it and passing it the user.

What’s great about this pattern is that we’ve decoupled our parent component from our child component. The parent component manages the state, and the consumer of the parent component can decide in which way they’d like to apply the arguments they receive from the parent to their UI.

To demonstrate this, let’s say in another file we want to render a *Profile* instead of a *Badge*, because we’re using the render callback pattern, we can easily swap around the UI without changing our implementation of the parent (*Twitter*) component.

```jsx
<Twitter username='tylermcginnis'>
  {(user) => user === null
    ? <Loading />
    : <Profile info={user} />}
</Twitter>
```

------

> What is the difference between a **controlled** component and an **uncontrolled** component?

A large part of React is this idea of having components control and manage their own state. What happens when we throw native HTML form elements (input, select, textarea, etc) into the mix? Should we have React be the “single source of truth” like we’re used to doing with React or should we allow that form data to live in the DOM like we’re used to typically doing with HTML form elements? These two questions are at the heart of controlled vs. uncontrolled components.

A **controlled** component is a component where React is in *control* and is the single source of truth for the form data. As you can see below, *username* doesn’t live in the DOM but instead lives in our component state. Whenever we want to update *username*, we call *setState* as we’re used to.

```jsx
class ControlledForm extends Component {
  state = {
    username: ''
  }
  updateUsername = (e) => {
    this.setState({
      username: e.target.value,
    })
  }
  handleSubmit = () => {}
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          value={this.state.username}
          onChange={this.updateUsername} />
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

An **uncontrolled** component is where your form data is handled by the DOM, instead of inside your React component.

You use *refs* to accomplish this.

```jsx
class UnControlledForm extends Component {
  input = React.createRef()
  handleSubmit = () => {
    console.log("Input Value: ", this.input.current.value)
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type='text'
          ref={} />
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

Though uncontrolled components are typically easier to implement since you just grab the value from the DOM using refs, it’s typically recommended that you favor controlled components over uncontrolled components. The main reasons for this are that controlled components support instant field validation, allow you to conditionally disable/enable buttons, enforce input formats, and are more “the React way”.

------

> In which lifecycle method do you make AJAX requests with a Class component?

AJAX requests should go in the **componentDidMount** lifecycle method.

The reason for this is because you can’t guarantee the AJAX request won’t resolve before the component mounts. If it did, that would mean that you’d be trying to setState on an unmounted component, which not only won’t work but React will yell at you for. Doing AJAX in componentDidMount will guarantee that there’s a component to update.

------

> What does **shouldComponentUpdate** do and why is it important?

Above we talked about reconciliation and what React does when setState is called. What **shouldComponentUpdate** does is it’s a lifecycle method that allows us to opt out of this reconciliation process for certain components (and their child components). Why would we ever want to do this? As mentioned above, “The end goal of reconciliation is to, in the most efficient way possible, update the UI based on new state”. If we know that a certain section of our UI isn’t going to change, there’s no reason to have React go through the trouble of trying to figure out if it should. By returning false from **shouldComponentUpdate**, React will assume that the current component, and all its child components, will stay the same as they currently are.

> Note, you *probably* don’t ever need to use `shouldComponentUpdate`. React is typically fast enough by default.

------

> How do you tell React to build in **Production** mode and what will that do?

You set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `production`. When React in production mode, it’ll strip out any extra development features like warnings.

------

> Why would you use `React.Children.map(props.children, () => )` instead of `props.children.map(() => )`

It’s not guaranteed that *props.children* will be an array.

Take this code for example,

```jsx
<Parent>
  <h1>Welcome.</h1>
</Parent>
```

Inside of `Parent`, if we were to try to map over children using `props.children.map` it would throw an error because `props.children` is an object, not an array.

React only makes `props.children` an array if there are more than one child elements, like this

```jsx
<Parent>
  <h1>Welcome.</h1>
  <h2>props.children will now be an array</h2>
</Parent>
```

You want to favor `React.Children.map` because its implemention takes into account that *props.children* may be an array or an object.

------

> Describe how events are handled in React.

In order to solve cross browser compatibility issues, your event handlers in React will be passed instances of *SyntheticEvent*, which is React’s cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. These synthetic events have the same interface as native events you’re used to, except they work identically across all browsers.

What’s mildly interesting is that React doesn’t actually attach events to the child nodes themselves. React will listen to all events at the top level using a single event listener. This is good for performance and it also means that React doesn’t need to worry about keeping track of event listeners when updating the DOM.

------

> What is the difference between **createElement** and **cloneElement**?

*createElement* is what JSX gets compiled to and is what React uses to create React Elements (object representations of some UI). *cloneElement* is used to clone an element and pass it new props. They nailed the naming on these two 🙂.

------

> What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to **setState** and what is its purpose?

A callback function which will be invoked when `setState` has finished and the component is re-rendered.

Something that’s not spoken of a lot is that `setState` is asynchronous, which is why it takes in a second callback function. Typically it’s best to use another lifecycle method rather than relying on this callback function, but it’s good to know it exists.

```js
this.setState(
  { username: 'tylermcginnis' },
  () => console.log('setState has finished and the component has re-rendered.')
)
```

------

> What is wrong with this code?

```jsx
this.setState((prevState, props) => {
  return {
    streak: prevState.streak + props.count
  }
})
```

Nothing is wrong with it 🙂. It’s rarely used and not well known, but you can also pass a function to **setState** that receives the previous state and props and returns a new state, just as we’re doing above. And not only is nothing wrong with it, but it’s also actively recommended if you’re setting state based on the previous state.





### (Bonus) React "AHA" Moments

One of my main goals, whenever I’m teaching or writing technical content, is to maximize “aha” moments. An [“aha” moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect) is a moment of sudden insight or clarity; when the subject matter suddenly makes sense. We’ve all experienced them, and the best teachers I know can understand their audience and adapt the lesson to maximize these moments.

Throughout the last few years, I’ve taught React in just about every medium. Throughout that time I’ve been taking notes on what triggers these “aha” moments, specifically for learning React. About two weeks ago I came across [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/5gmywc/what_were_the_biggest_aha_moments_you_had_while/) which had the same idea. So what I want to do in this post is to share my collection of these moments while also adding my thoughts on some of the moments shared in that Reddit thread. Hopefully, it will help React “click” for you if it hasn’t yet.

------

> fn(d) = V. Your UI is a function of your state and props are to components what arguments are to functions.

One of the best parts of React is that you can use the same intuition that you have about JavaScript functions for when and where you should create React components. However, instead of your function taking in some arguments and returning a value, your function is going to take in some arguments and return an object representation of your UI. This idea can be summed up in the following formula, fn(d) = V. A Function takes in some Data and returns a View. This is a beautiful way to think about developing user interfaces because now your UI is just composed of different function invocations. This is how you’re already used to building applications and now you can take advantage of all of the benefits of function composition when building UIs.

------

> In React, your entire application’s UI is built using function composition and JSX is an abstraction over those functions.

The most common reaction I see from first timers using React is “React seems cool, but I really don’t like JSX. It breaks my separation of concerns”. JSX isn’t trying to be HTML, and it’s definitely more than just a templating language. There are two important things to realize with JSX. First, [JSX is an abstraction over *React.createElement*](https://ui.dev/react-elements-vs-react-components/) which is a function that returns an object representation of the DOM. I know that was wordy but the tl;dr is that whenever you write JSX, once it’s compiled, you’ll have a JavaScript object which represents the actual DOM (or whatever View is representative of the platform you’re on, iOS, Android, etc). Then React is able to analyze that object, diff it against the previous object representation of the DOM it created, then update the DOM only where a change occurred. This has some performance upsides to it but more importantly, shows that JSX really is “just JavaScript”. Second, because JSX is just JavaScript, you get all the benefits that JavaScript provides (composition, linting, debugging) but still with the declarativeness (and familiarity) of HTML.

------

> “Components don’t necessarily have to correspond to DOM nodes.”

When we first learn React, we’re taught that “Components are the building blocks of React. They take in input and return some UI (descriptor)”. Does that mean that every component needs to directly return UI descriptors as we’re typically taught? What if we wanted to have a component render another component ([Higher Order Component](https://ui.dev/react-higher-order-components/) pattern)? What if we wanted a component to manage some slice of state and then instead of returning a UI descriptor, it returns a function invocation passing in the state ([Render Props](https://ui.dev/react-render-props/) pattern)? What if we had a component that was in charge of managing sound rather than a visual UI, what would it return? What’s great about React is you don’t **have** to return typical “views” from your components. As long as what eventually gets returned is a React element, null, or false, you’re good.

You can return other components,

```javascript
render () {
  return <MyOtherComponent />
}
```

you can return function invocations,

```javascript
render () {
  return this.props.children(this.someImportantState)
}
```

or, you can return nothing.

```javascript
render () {
  return null
}
```

------

> “When two components need to share state, I need to lift that state up instead of trying to keep their states in sync.”

A component-based architecture naturally makes sharing state more difficult. If two components rely on the same state, where should that state live? This was such a popular question that it spurred an entire ecosystem of solutions which eventually ended with Redux. Redux’s solution is to put that shared state in another location called a “store”. Components can then subscribe to any portions of the store they need and can also dispatch “actions” to update the store. React’s solution is to find the nearest parent of both of those components and have that parent manage the shared state, passing it down to the child components as needed. There are pros and cons to both approaches, but it’s important to be aware that both solutions exist.

------

> “Inheritance is unnecessary in React, and both containment and specialization can be achieved with composition.”

React has always been, for good reason, very liberal in adopting functional programming principles. A precedent move away from inheritance and towards composition was when the release of React 0.13 made it clear React wasn’t adding support for Mixins with ES6 classes. The reason for this is because most everything that can be accomplished with Mixins (or inheritance) can also be accomplished through composition, but with less downsides. If you’re coming to React from an inheritance heavy mindset, this new way of thinking may be difficult and probably won’t feel too natural. If you’d like to read more, check out [JavaScript Inheritance vs Composition](https://ui.dev/javascript-inheritance-vs-composition/)

------

> “The separation of container and presentational components.”

If you think about the anatomy of a React component, it usually involves some state, potentially some lifecycle hooks, and markup via JSX. What if, instead of having all of that in one component, we separate the state and the lifecycle hooks from the markup. This leaves us with two components. The first has state, life cycle methods, and is responsible for how the component works. The second receives data via props and is responsible for how the component looks. This approach allows us to have better reusability of our presentational components since they’re no longer coupled to the data they receive. I’ve also found that it will enable you (and newcomers to your project) to better understand the structure of your application. You’re able to swap out the implementation of a component without seeing or caring about the UI and vice versa - designers can tweak the UI without ever having to worry about how those presentational components are receiving data.

------

> “If you try to keep most of your components pure, stateless things become a lot simpler to maintain.”

This is another benefit of separating your presentational components from your container components. State is the sidekick of inconsistency. By drawing the right lines of separation, you’re able to drastically improve the predictability of your application by encapsulating the complexity of it.
