### Introduction to Props

#### props

> `props` are to components what arguments are to functions.



#### Passing data to a component

You pass data to a React component the same way youâ€™d set an attribute on an HTML element.

```jsx
<img src='' />
<Hello name='Tyler' /> // passing in a name prop to the Hello component.
```



#### Accessing props

In a class component, you can get access to props from the `props` key on the componentâ€™s instance (`this`).

Each prop that is passed to a component is added as a key on `this.props`. If no props are passed to a component, `this.props` will be an empty object.

```jsx
class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello, {this.props.first} {this.props.last}</h1>
    )
  }
}

<Hello first='Tyler' last='McGinnis' />
```

Itâ€™s important to note that weâ€™re not limited to what we can pass as props to components. Just like we can [pass functions as arguments to other functions](https://ui.dev/async-javascript-from-callbacks-to-promises-to-async-await/), weâ€™re also able to pass components (or really anything we want) as props to other components.

```jsx
<Profile 
  username='tylermcginnis'
  authed={true}
  logout={() => handleLogout()}
  header={<h1>ðŸ‘‹</h1>}
/>
```

If you pass a prop without a value, that value will be set to `true`. These are equivalent.

```js
<Profile authed={true} />

<Profile authed />
```
