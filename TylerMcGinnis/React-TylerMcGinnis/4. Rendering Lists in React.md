#### React

Typically you use `.map` when you need to create a new array, based on a previous array. Something like this.

```jsx
const tweets = [
  { id: 1, stars: 13, text: 'Turns out "git reset --hard HEAD^" was a terrible idea.' },
  { id: 2, stars: 87, text: 'Tech conferences are too expensive.' },
  { id: 3, stars: 51, text: 'Clean code is subjective. Optimize for deletion.' },
  { id: 4, stars: 19, text: 'Maybe the real benefit of open source was the friendships we made along the way?' },
]

<ul id="tweets">
	{
    tweets.map((tweet) => (
    	<li>
      	{tweet.text}
      </li>
    ))
  }
</ul>
```

#### Caveat 

Unfortunately, we’re not quite done yet. There’s just one small addition we need to make to our code. Whenever you use `.map` to create a list in React, you need to make sure that you add a **unique** `key` prop to each list item.

```jsx
<ul id="tweets">
  {tweets.map((tweet) => (
    <li key={tweet.id}>
      {tweet.text}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

It’s React’s job to make rendering the list as fast as possible. When you give each list item a **unique** `key` prop, it helps React know which items, if any, change throughout different renders of that component.
