You will build two projects during this course. The first is a Tic Tac Toe game built with vanilla DOM APIs and will happen mid-way through the course.

The second is a very simple webserver built with NodeJS. This will let you practice configuring TypeScript for NodeJS development.

The curriculum will be Hacker News clone that you will build entirely on your own. I built it using vanilla DOM APIs, but if you want to use a front-end framework like React or Vue, or build it as a NodeJS web server, you are more than welcome to. Be aware that front-end frameworks have their own type definitions that we donâ€™t cover in this course which you will have to work with.
