To use TypeScript, we’ll need to install it globally with NPM.

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Once that’s done, we can use the `tsc` command to run the TypeScript compiler.

If we’ve installed TypeScript locally in our project, we can also run that version using `npx`

```bash
npx tsc
```

During this course, we’ll assume that TypeScript is globally installed.

#### TSConfig.json

The first command we’ll run will initialize our tsconfig.json file. We can use this file to tell TypeScript how we want it to run its compiler. We could also use a long list of command line flags, but that seems tedious and repetitive. To initialize the file, run

```bash
tsc --init
```

TSC is the TypeScript command line tool. We run this to type check and compile our code into JavaScript. If we have a tsconfig.json file in our project directory, `tsc` will pick up all of the configuration options we used in that file. We can override those options using command line flags. During this course, we’ll assume that all of our TypeScript code has an accompanying tsconfig.json file, which means all we need to do to run TypeScript is run `tsc` with no options.

When we open up the `tsconfig.json` file, it looks something like this. Don’t get overwhelmed, we don’t need to learn all of this at once. This is just to illustrate how configurable TypeScript is if we need to adjust something.

```

There are a lot of things that we can configure here! Fortunately, it’s given us some good defaults and explanations for all of the other settings. We’ll talk about many of these settings in a later lesson, but for now we’ll focus on the ones that aren’t commented out.

```json
"target": "es5",
```

The `target` field lets us choose what version of JavaScript the compiler will transform our code into. This is useful if we want to target older browsers, like Internet Explorer 11. Targeting older browsers often means adding more code to your JavaScript files for polyfills and workarounds. Also, modern browsers are able to add optimizations for the newer syntax which can’t be replicated by compilers. There’s a bonus section later in the course which explains what each of the `target` options does to your compiled code.

```json
"module": "commonjs",
```

The `module` field lets us change what module system the output of our bundle will use. This affects how our `import` and `export` statements are transformed in the final JavaScript output. If I were making an app for NodeJS or if I were using a bundler like Webpack, I would choose CommonJS.

```json
"isolatedModules": true
```

This setting is commented out, but it’s important to know about. When this is on, TypeScript expects ever file to be a module. That means it has either an `import` or an `export` statement somewhere in the file. If we don’t have anything to import or export for some reason, we can turn a file into a module by adding `export default {}` to the end of the file. This setting is helpful when working with external tools, like Babel.

```json
"strict": true,
```

Our `tsconfig.json` file lets us change how strict the type checker is when checking our types. There are a lot of options which we can choose from, but if we just want to enable all of them and have the type system catch as many bugs as possible, all we have to do is enable the `strict` flag. **I’ll have it enabled for most of this course, and I encourage you to do the same.** Here are some benefits you’ll get from using the `strict` flag.

- `noImplicitAny` - `any` is a type in TypeScript which turns off the type checker for a variable and makes it act like regular JavaScript. If we want a variable to do that, we should be explicit about it so we don’t accidentally create type errors for ourselves. We’ll learn about the `any` type in the section on special TypeScript types.
- `strictNullChecks` - With this on, TypeScript will automatically warn us any time a variable could be `null` or `undefined`. This will help us avoid the dreaded `Cannot read property of undefined` errors. We’ll cover this more in the section on narrowing types.
- `noImplicitThis` - If we ever try to access the `this` variable on an object or class, TypeScript will warn us to make a type annotation so we know what properties we can expect to find on `this`. We’ll learn more about this in the section on classes.
- strictPropertyInitialization - This flag warns us if any of our class properties aren’t initialized in the constructor. That would mean that the property is undefined, which could lead to unexpected bugs. We’ll look more into this in the section on classes.

```json
`esModuleInterop`: true
```

This flag makes it much easier to use code from both the CommonJS and the ES Modules system. This is often necessary when working with packages from NPM. It adds a small bit of code to our JavaScript output, but saves a lot of headaches.

```json
"skipLibCheck": true,
```

This flag tells TypeScript not to check all of the files that we are importing from the node_modules folder so the compiler and type checker can run faster. This means we have to trust that the type definitions for the packages we import are accurate, but if you want more confidence in your types at the expense of longer compilation times, you can turn this off.

```json
"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
```

Some Linux-based systems have case-sensitive file systems. That means that a file named `MyFile.ts` can’t be accessed by using `import myFunction from './myFile.ts'`. I’ve run into issues before where my app works perfectly on my non-case-sensitive development computer, but when I try to deploy it to a case-sensitive production environment, I discover I accidentally tried to import a file using the wrong casing. This option will warn you if you do that.
