TypeScript gives us two types which expand on `object` and `arrays`: Enums and Tuples. The purpose of both of these types is to add even more structure to our types. Lets take a look at some situations when these might be helpful.

#### Enums

One common programming tip is to avoid using magic values in our code. These are values which change how our program behaves, but the values themselves aren’t named. Take this function for example:

```ts
function seasonsGreetings(season: string) {
  if (season === "winter") return "⛄️";
  if (season === "spring") return "🐰";
  if (season === "summer") return "🏖";
  if (season === "autumn") return "🍂";
}
```

In this case, the string values `winter`, `spring`, `summer`, and `autumn` are magic strings. Having them in just one function is fine, but it we were to reuse them over and over in our codebase, there’s a chance we might have a typo or miss one of the options. Also, it might not be clear what the magic value represents. That’s why it’s common to put our magic values into named constants.

```ts
const SEASONS = {
  winter: "winter",
  spring: "spring",
  summer: "summer",
  autumn: "autumn",
};

function seasonsGreetings(season: string) {
  if (season === SEASONS.winter) return "⛄️";
  // ...
}
```

This puts our magic strings in one place, gives them a name, and makes us less likely to misspell them, since TypeScript will warn us if we use the wrong property name for `SEASONS`. This doesn’t solve all of the problems, though. We can still pass any string into our `seasonsGreetings` function, and our object definition is a little verbose. We can use an Enum to create a type safe definition of named constants which we can reference elsewhere in our code.

Here is our same function, but implemented with an Enum instead of an object.

```ts
enum Seasons {
  winter,
  spring,
  summer,
  autumn,
}

function seasonsGreetings(season: Seasons) {
  if ((season = Seasons.winter)) return "⛄️";
  // ...
}

const greeting = seasonsGreetings(Seasons.winter);
```

Notice that we are able to use `Seasons` as both a type and a value. We tell TypeScript that the `season` parameter of our `seasonsGreetings` function is a `Seasons` type, which means it has to be one of the constant properties we defined in our Enum. Then, when we call our function, instead of passing a `string`, we pass one of the properties of `Seasons` into the function.

Our Enum acts like an object, where the `string`s we include are the property names and their values are incrementing `number`s, starting at 0. Notice that when we assign the Enum as a type for a variable, we can use any of the properties of the Enum as values for that variable.

Most types are removed when TypeScript compiles code to JavaScript. Enums, on the other hand, are translated into JavaScript snippets which represent their shape and behavior. That makes Enums both a type and a value. If I were to run the `Seasons` enum through the TypeScript compiler, this is what it would output:

```js
var Seasons;
(function (Seasons) {
  Seasons[(Seasons["winter"] = 0)] = "winter";
  Seasons[(Seasons["spring"] = 1)] = "spring";
  Seasons[(Seasons["summer"] = 2)] = "summer";
  Seasons[(Seasons["autumn"] = 3)] = "autumn";
})(Seasons || (Seasons = {}));

console.log(Seasons);
// {
//   '0': 'winter',
//   '1': 'spring',
//   '2': 'summer',
//   '3': 'autumn',
//   winter: 0,
//   spring: 1,
//   summer: 2,
//   autumn: 3
// }
```

There are a few things to learn from this. First, TypeScript implements enums as an object very similar to the object we used before. However, it uses `number`s to represent the constants instead of `string`s. Also, we can see that Enums allow us to both access the `number`s using the property names, but also access the property names with the appropriate `number` index.

If we wanted to start our enum with a different `number`, we just put it in front of the first item and the rest will auto-increment.

```ts
enum Seasons {
  winter = 12,
  spring,
  summer,
  autumn,
}
console.log(SEASONS.summer); // 14
```

Or we could assign each Enum property its own `number`.

```ts
enum Seasons {
  winter = 15,
  spring = 200,
  summer = 12,
  autumn = 59,
}
```

We can even assign Enum properties `string` values. Remember that if you do this, you have to assign `string`s to all of the properties.

```ts
enum Seasons {
  winter = "snowy",
  spring = "rainy",
  summer = "sunny",
  autumn = "windy",
}
const mySeason = Seasons.winter; // const mySeason: Seasons
console.log(mySeason); // "snowy"
```

One thing to remember is that Enums are their own types with a unique behavior. You can actually assign `number`s to Enum variables so long as the Enum doesn’t use `string` values. However, you cannot assign a `string` property to an Enum variable, even if the Enum uses `string` values. We have to use the properties of the Enum instead.

```ts
enum Colors {
    red,
    green,
    blue
}
let myEnum = Colors.red;
let myNumber: number = myEnum; // This works
myEnum = 2 // This also works

enum Seasons {
    spring = "spring"
    summer = "summer"
    autumn = "fall"
    winter = "winter"
}
let myStringEnum = Seasons.spring
myStringEnum = "winter" // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Seasons'.
myStringEnum = Seasons.winter // This works
```

Enums are often used to represent the names of different finite states. For example, we could use an Enum to model the different states of a Promise.

```ts
enum PromiseStates {
  pending,
  fulfilled,
  rejected,
}
const FakePromise = {
  state: PromiseStates.pending,
  resolve: function () {
    this.state = PromiseStates.fulfilled;
  },
  reject: function () {
    this.state = PromiseStates.rejected;
  },
};
```

#### Tuple

Most of the time when we use arrays, we intend for it to be variable length, which means we can add and remove items from the array. We also expect all of the elements to be the same type. The type `string[]` means an array of any size that can only be strings. What if we had an array where different items were different types?

For example, the `useState` hook in React returns an array of two things: The state value, and a function to update the state. Here’s a very simplified, naïve implementation of `useState`.

```ts
let simpleState: string;
function simpleUseState(initialState: string) {
  if (!simpleState) {
    simpleState = initialState;
  }
  function updateState(newState: string) {
    simpleState = initialState;
  }
  return [simpleState, updateState];
}

const [username, setUsername] = simpleUseState("alexanderson");
// const username: string | ((newState: string) => void)
// const setUsername: string | ((newState: string) => void)
```

We can see that our naïve solution didn’t hold up well. Instead of giving us an array where the first item is a `string` and the second item is a function, `simpleUseState` returned an array where *each item* is *either* a `string` or a function. These are called Union types, and they are annotated with the vertical bar (`|`) between the different types. We’ll learn more about them later on in the course.

For right now, all that we need to know is that TypeScript won’t let us use `username` or `setUsername` as a `string` or function without us checking to see which it is first. We can do this with type narrowing.

```ts
setUsername("Alex");
// Type Error: Not all constituents of type 'string | ((newState: string) => void)' are callable.
//     Type 'string' has no call signatures.

if (typeof setUsername === "function") {
  setUsername("Alex");
}
```

This would be much nicer if we could tell TypeScript that the first item in our array is a `string` and the second is a function. We can do that using Tuples.

Tuples are fixed-length arrays. We can tell TypeScript how many items are in the array, and what the type of each item is.

We write Tuples by wrapping our list of types in square brackets.

```ts
function simpleUseState(
  initialState: string
): [string, (newState: string) => void] {
  // The rest of the implementation goes here.
}
```

TypeScript will never infer an array of items to be a tuple, even if the items are of different types. Like we saw with our naïve example, TypeScript guessed we wanted an array of mixed types, not specific types for each index in the array. That means that when you create tuples, you *always* have to add a type annotation.

Destructuring our Tuple will yield the appropriate types on our values without us having to annotate them.

```ts
const [username, setUsername] = simpleUseState("alexanderson");
// const username: string
// const setUsername: (newState:string) => void
setUsername("Alex"); // No error
```
